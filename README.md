dungeongenerator
================
A web version of the warhammer dungeon room card deck, allowing you to easily navigate through a dungeon and create your own room types. You'll still have to create the tiles if you're playing with real minis though! This is just for fun with no intention of infringing on Games Workshop's copyrights. 



Currently considering re-working in Angular or some other framework; I'd rather finish this to a usable state first though...
